    <h1>Research Interests — Lovell Lab</h1>

    <p>The lab&#39;s main research interests center around engineering approaches to prevent and treat diseases using new nanotechnology-based approaches. </p>

        <h2>Porphysomes and PoP-liposomes</h2>
        <p>
            Liposome-like structures formed from porphyrin-phospholipid (PoP) can self-assemble and be used for imaging and therapeutic applications. PoP liposomes with lower amounts of PoP can be permeabilized by near-infrared laser irradiation for on-demand drug release. Doxil-like liposomes with a small amount of PoP exhibit light-activatable properties and enhance drug delivery in large tumors.
        </p>

        <h2>Surfactant-Stripped Micelles</h2>
        <p>
            Hydrophobic cargo can be dispersed in water with Pluronic (Poloxamer) surfactants and then processed at low temperature to remove free and loose surfactant. This surfactant stripping strategy can be used both for therapeutic cargo delivery and for contrast imaging applications.
        </p>

        <h2>Self-Assembling Vaccines</h2>
        <p>
            The lab is exploring novel vaccine immunogen formulation using PoP liposomes that contain cobalt in the bilayer. This formulation promotes serum-stable particle formation of peptides and recombinant protein antigens, leading to enhanced immune responses and flexible multiplexing approaches.
